# oxidot

A safe, concurrent, and oxidation-free dotfile manager for your home directory.

The oxidot dotfile manager empowers users to easily manage and distribute their
dotfile configurations across multiple machines through the use of
__clusters__.

A _cluster_ is a self-contained, deployable unit of dotfiles composed of one or
more __node repositories__. Each cluster defines its nodes in a dedicated
definition file, allowing precise control over how configurations are structured
and deployed.

Users can define multiple clusters that can coexist on the same machine. These
coexisting clusters can also depend on one another, enabling modular and
layered dotfile configurations.
